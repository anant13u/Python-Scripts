3. Joining Paths

Concatenating strings in Python is as easy as using the “+” sign between two words; however, when it comes to 
concatenating paths, things get a bit tricky. This happens because Mac OS uses forward slash “/”, while Windows 
uses backward slash “\” in the directory names, so you need a different approach if you want the Python code to 
be able to run cross-platform. Fortunately, the os and Pathlib modules can take care of that.


# os
os.path.join(os.getcwd(), 'Dataset')

# pathlib
from pathlib import Path, PurePath
PurePath.joinpath(Path.cwd(), 'Dataset')


If we print the code written above, we’ll get a path that contains the working directory plus “Dataset.” 
The Path will look like this /Users/frank/PycharmProjects/DataScience/Dataset. The OS library creates a string, 
while the Pathlib creates a PosixPath class. However, we haven’t created the “Dataset” folder. To create a directory 
check the next file system operation.
