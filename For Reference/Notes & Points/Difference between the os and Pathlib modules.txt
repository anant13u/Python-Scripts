import os
In [1]: os.getcwd()
Out [1]: /Users/frank/PycharmProjects/DataScience

As you can see from the code above, I got the directory that contains all my scripts for my data science project. 
This is my working directory in Pycharm. We can obtain the same directory with the Pathlib library



from pathlib import Path
In [1]: Path.cwd()
Out [1]: /Users/frank/PycharmProjects/DataScience

If we print either type(os.getcwd()) or the type(Path.cwd() we can see the main difference between the os and Pathlib 
modules. The first returns only a string, while the second returns a PosixPath object that can help us do extra operations.
