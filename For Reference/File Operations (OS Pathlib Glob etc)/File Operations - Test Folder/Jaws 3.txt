Here's why Jaws 3's original horror concept was a much better fit for the franchise - here's why it was dropped and why Steven Spielberg passed on the sequel. The original Jaws was a cultural event upon release in 1975, where it became the original summer blockbuster. While sequels were relatively rare during this era - even for big hits - Univeral was smart enough to know a follow-up was guaranteed to be a success. Steven Spielberg and Richard Dreyfuss were both busy with Close Encounters Of The Third Kind, so they passed on 1978's Jaws 2 - which almost dropped a shark for a squid.
