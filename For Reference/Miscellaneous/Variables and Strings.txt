Variable Assignment:
>>> x = 100

Variables:
1) Variables must start with a letter or a underscore
2) The rest of the name must consist of letters, numbers or underscores
3) Names are case-sensitive

Naming Conventions:

Most Python programmers prefer to use standard style conventions when naming things: 
1) Most variables should be snake_case (underscores between words)
2) Most variables should also be lowercase, with some exceptions
CAPITAL_SNAKE_CASE usually refers to constants (e.g. PI = 3.14)
UpperCamelCase usually refers to a class
3) Variables that start and end with two underscores (called "dunder" for double underscore) are supposed to be private or left alone

Data Types:

bool (Booleans): True or False values (True and False are case-sensitive in this case)
int (Integers): an integer (1,2,3)
str (String): a sequence of unicode characters
list: an ordered sequence of values of other data types, e.g. [1,2,3] or ["a","b","c"]
dict: a collection of key values, e.g. {"first_name": "Anant", "last_name": "Upadhyay"}

Dynamic Typing:
Python is highly flexible about reassigning variables to different types:
We call this dynamic typing, since variables can change types readily.
Other languages, such as C++, are statically-typed, and variables are stuck with their originally-assigned type.

None:
>>> child = None
>>> child
None
>>> type(child)
<class 'NoneType'>
