The purpose of this script is to be able to rename multiple files at once in any given folder.

In the file, you'll find the following variables:

1) pth - This variable will store the directory path wherein lie the files you wish to rename.

2) entries - This is the variable which will use the os module and list all the files from that folder and store within itself.

3) txt2replace - As the name suggests this variable asks the user for the text which needs to be replaced from the names of the files in that folder.

4) newtext - This variable will contain the new text which replaces txt2replace in the files' names.

5) str = entry.find(txt2replace) #With this method we check the presence of a substring within another string. 
    # If the substring is present the method will return the number which denotes the beginning of the substring. 
    # If the substring isn't present, the method will return -1.

The renaming done by this script cannot be undone so please proceed carefully.
